This tool when combined with the "Remove display from desktop" option allows the use of display audio without adding a "phantom" display to the display space for windows.

The tool can be closed after the intial display activation however on any display reconfiguration operation it seems to disconnect any SpecialPurpose displays where the process that activated it ( e.g this tool ) is not running.

By default the display will be configured to use the lowest refresh rate possible at the "preferred" resolution, the lowest resolution possible can be requested by passing --min as an argument.

The tool may be started without a console window by passing the --no-console argument.
